This is the construction pipeline for [p6mA](https://github.com/Konglab404/p6mA), which is a sequence-based N<sup>6</sup>-methyladenine(6mA) predictor. The paper has been published in *Epigenetics & Chromatin*(PMID: 32093759
        
        ) with title "Identification of DNA N6-methyladenine sites by integration of sequence features"**. According to this repository, readers can replicate all the results in the manuscript.

Before running the scripts, users need to install the feature extractor [RTFE](https://github.com/Konglab404/RTFE), which implements methods like EIIP/PSTNP etc. and can extract the DNA features as the input of XGboost. The RTFE only relies on 2 packages (*stringr* and *magrittr*) and is easy to install.

For 3D visualization, users also need to install *rgl* package.
